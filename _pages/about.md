I’m a software developer and data analyst with a strong background in `Python`, `React Native`, and `full-stack development`. I’ve led projects that delivered mobile apps for 500+ users, built automation tools that boosted efficiency by 70%, and developed data-driven models that improved prediction accuracy and reliability. With experience spanning startups, freelance work, and collaborative teams, I enjoy creating scalable solutions that merge **clean design, efficient code, and data-driven insights**.
